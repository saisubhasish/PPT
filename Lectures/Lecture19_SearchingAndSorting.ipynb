    "The idea is to use Binary Search. We fix a value for the number of pages as mid of current minimum and maximum. We initialize minimum and maximum as 0 and **sum-of-all-pages** respectively. If a current **mid** can be a solution, then we search on the lower half, else we search in higher half.\n",

    "Now the question arises, how to check if a mid value is feasible or not? Basically, we need to check if we can assign pages to all students in a way that the maximum number doesn't exceed **mid** value. To do this, we sequentially assign pages to every student while the current number of assigned pages doesn't exceed the value. In this process, if the number of students becomes more than m, then the solution is not feasible. Else feasible."
