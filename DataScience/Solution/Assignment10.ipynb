The convolutional layers in a CNN apply various filters to the input data, detecting different patterns and features at different spatial scales. These filters capture features such as edges, corners, and textures. By applying multiple convolutional layers, a CNN can learn hierarchical representations of the input data, with higher-level layers capturing more complex and abstract features.

Siamese networks utilize twin networks to embed the appearance of the target object and perform similarity comparison between the target and candidate regions in subsequent frames. Correlation filters employ filters to learn the appearance model of the target object and use correlation operations to track the object across frames. Online learning-based methods continuously update the appearance model of the target object during tracking, adapting to changes in appearance and conditions.

This can be achieved through techniques such as model averaging, where the predictions of multiple models are averaged, or using more advanced methods such as stacking or boosting. Ensemble learning helps reduce overfitting, improve generalization, and capture diverse patterns in the data. It can be especially beneficial when training data is limited or when different models have complementary strengths.\n",
