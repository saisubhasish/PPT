It is commonly used for clustering and visualization tasks. A SOM consists of an input layer and a competitive layer, where each neuron in the competitive layer represents a prototype or codebook vector. During training, the SOM adjusts its weights to map similar input patterns to neighboring neurons, forming clusters in the competitive layer. SOMs are particularly useful for exploratory data analysis and visualization of high-dimensional data."

However, a more complex model is more prone to overfitting and may not generalize well to unseen data. Regularization techniques, by penalizing complex models, strike a balance between model complexity and generalization performance. By discouraging excessive complexity, regularization helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data."
